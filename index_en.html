        <p class="intro__text">According to the Russian Public Opinion Research Center's surveys, 95% of the Russians
          want to travel, but only 36% want to travel domestically on vacation. Mostly, people do not believe there is
          anything of interest to see. However, Russia is a whole universe with gentle seas in the south, thick forests
          of the Sayan Mountains and harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau. This beauty is available to anyone, not millions
          in cash, travel documents and many hours of flight needed. You can see it, like Vera Bashmakova, a brave young
          mother, who grabbed her three children, put them into her Lada car and drove 20 thousand kilometers around her
          home country. We have selected some vacation worthy places and wrote about them.</p>

          <p class="place__paragraph">Here, in the middle of forests and sand dunes, there are two water horizons: the
            calm Curonian bay on one side and the rippled Baltic Sea waves on the other. A unique natural zone at the
            edge of the Russian enclave.</p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">This is not where the Kaliningrad region ends. For a traveler and explorer there
            is also the westernmost point of Russia, the Baltic Spit, and the German heritage of the small scattered
            seaside towns. There is no hustle here, only the calmness of nature and the smell of steely and cold sea.

          <p class="place__paragraph">You may have watched films by Zvyagintsev and even heard the history of the Arctic
            Festival in Teriberka. Perhaps the word "Khibiny" is not buried under the snow of school memories of
            geography. Perhaps you weren't interested in the super-deep borehole that penetrates the earth's crust, but
            apathy has long conquered you. But you can make the first step towards bringing your dream of seeing
            northern lights to life with a ticket to Murmansk.</p>

          <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of all because of the
            mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see slopes covered with pine trees, mountain rivers and
            lakes. And if you open the windows in the car, you will know the invisible local wonder â€” the mountain air.
          </p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">The Altai climate is moderate, so it's best to go here in the summer. This way
            you'll see all the diversity of the local flora and fauna. Elks roam the forests of the Altai, eagles fly
            over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous Pallas's cats also inhabit the Altai Krai.

            the largest source of fresh water and one of the most beautiful places in Russia.</p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">Of course it's all true. But Baikal is still the perfect place for a skijoring
            competition. It's such a sport, when a skier ties themselves to a motorcycle and the tandem tries to gain
            the highest speed possible on ice. In March 2019 at the Baikal Mile festival the world record speed of
            197.011 km/h was set.</p>

          <p class="place__paragraph">Siberia ends not in the Urals, but in Karelia: the Siberian larch, which makes up
            the taiga, does not grow west of Vodlozero. And it grows up to 30 meters here, because the forests of
            Karelian national parks have never been touched by an axe thanks to impassible marshes. Some of the pines
            are more than half a millennium old. Touch a living creature that saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible did.
            In the unspoiled forest you can walk for a hundred kilometers and never see a trail. And the ground on the
            occasional paths is marked with bear claws to show everyone who rules this place.</p>
